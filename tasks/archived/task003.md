# Goal

Add a get://test-read endpoint that:
- reads the file input.txt from the data folder
- generate a random greeting based on that content
- writes it to hello.txt
after the ai is done, use python to read that file and output the quote.

- if the file already exists, override it
- if the data folder does not exist, try to create it
